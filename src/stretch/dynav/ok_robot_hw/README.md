# Robot Side Code

Most of the heavy code will be running in the workstation and will communicate with the robot through sockets

## Preparation to run robot side codes

Our hardware codes heavily rely on robot controller provided by [home-robot](https://github.com/facebookresearch/home-robot).

You need to install the home-robot on stretch robot following instructions provided by [home-robot-hw](https://github.com/facebookresearch/home-robot/blob/main/docs/install_robot.md) before running any robot side codes on robot.

To check whether home-robot is installed properly and got familiar with running home-robot based codes, we recommend you try to run [these test scripts](https://github.com/facebookresearch/home-robot/blob/main/tests/hw_manual_test.py).

Once you finished installing home-robot, follow [these steps](../docs/robot-installation.md) to enable OK-Robot use home-robot controllers.

The success of OK-Robot system also depends on robot calibration and accurate urdf file, so make sure you follow [these calibration steps](../docs/robot-calibration.md) to obtain an accurate urdf file for your robot.

## Start home-robot

```
stretch_robot_home.py
roslaunch home_robot_hw startup_stretch_hector_slam.launch
```

## Start Robot Control

```
python run.py -x1 [x1] -y1 [y1] -x2 [x2] -y2 [y2] -ip [your workstation ip]
```

- **\[x1, y1\]** - Coordinated of tape on which the base of the robot is on
- **\[x2, y2\]** - Coordinates of the secondary tape.
- **ip** - Your workstation ip, the robot will try to communicate with this ip
- **np** - Navigation port number, the robot will listen to this port number to get planned navigation paths (default: 5555)
- **mp** - Manipulation port number, the robot will listen to this port number to get estimated manipulation pose (default: 5556)

After running run.py it will go through 4 states in each cycle.

- Picking Navigation
- Manipulation
- Placing Navigation
- Placing

For each navigation stage it asks A \[Object Name\], B \[Near by Object Name\]
